CssNakedDay
===========

This plugin disables all stylesheets on CSS Naked Day.
http://naked.dustindiaz.com/

As long as you're using Rails' stylesheet_link_tag helper, your CSS will automatically be hidden on Naked Day (April 9, 2008).

It also adds a method to the Date class so you can check if a day is Naked Day.

Example
=======

<% if Date.today.is_css_naked_day? %>
  <h3>What happened to the design?</h3>
